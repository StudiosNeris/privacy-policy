    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This application is provided by [Uygulama Geliştiricinizin Adı/Şirket Adı] and uses third-party services, including <strong>Google Firebase</strong> and <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, to operate and improve its functionality.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Personal Data:</strong> The application does <strong>not</strong> directly collect or store personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or phone number) from its users.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Game Data:</strong> Game progress and settings are stored locally on the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Analytics and Authentication:</strong> We utilize <strong>Google Firebase</strong> services for application operation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Authentication (Anonymous):</strong> The app signs in users anonymously using Firebase Auth. This generates a unique, non-personal <strong>User ID (UID)</strong> linked to the device, which is used internally by Firebase to distinguish users and is not personally identifiable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remote Configuration:</strong> We use Firebase Remote Config to dynamically update app settings (like the selected mini-game type) without requiring an app update. This process does not collect personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Firebase services may automatically collect certain device and usage data (e.g., crash reports, session length, device model) as described in their documentation.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Advertising (AdMob):</strong> The application displays third-party advertisements via <strong>Google AdMob</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AdMob uses identifiers like your device's advertising ID to serve personalized ads and measure ad effectiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AdMob and its partners may collect and process end-users' data for various purposes, including serving, targeting, and measuring ads.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
